# Movie API
2024 final project for Application Development 1

## Scenario 

Our project is a movie recommendation API that allows the user to sign in as a client to search through a database of films. The interface will allow the client to search for their favorite movies based on the directors, actors, genre, and title. Our project will also allow the client to add movies to their watchlist, see the reviews that movie critiques leave on the film. Furthermore, the user can leave their own review on the film by giving the movie a rating and comment. In addition, we will have a recommendation engine that generates movies that seem appealing for the user in reference to their search history and their preferences.
